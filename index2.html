    <article>I am a highly motivated person, a creative and proactive researcher with experience working independently and as part of a team. I enjoy being part of interdisciplinary research as it brings different perspectives and expertise into addressing a research problem. My interest includes molecular parasitology, infectious disease genomics, host-pathogen interaction, bioinformatics and drug/vaccine discovery for sustainable disease control. I possess excellent communication skills in both speaking and writing which enable me to effectively communicate my research findings and ideas to a wide range of audiences.

   <h3>Research Experiences</h3>
   <p><strong>Master of Research (MRes) thesis;</strong> Aberystwyth University, UK</p>
   <p>I undertook a 1-year research project titled; developing a Novel Diagnostic Method; Multiplex PCR for the diagnosis of Cryptosporidium infection.<br>This research seeks to comparatively test for diagnostic sensitivities of standard PCR techniques targeting individual loci, and to develop a novel approach that can improve turnaround time and gDNA expenditure by multiplexing primers targeting and amplifying multiple gene loci, which can subsequently be sequenced directly to generate sufficient information for specific genotype and subtype identification in laboratory and clinical samples.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Used primer3 bioinformatics tools to design primers for specific regions of Cryptosporidium genome</li>
    <li>Performed DNA extraction from Cryptosporidium oocyst using freeze-thaw thermal extraction method</li>
    <li>Performed ligation and cloning of PCR products of interest</li>
    <li>Performed miniprep purification and qubits assay quantification</li>
    <li>Performed PCR, RT-PCR and qPCR for gene amplification</li>
    <li>Perform gel electrophoresis to analyse sizes of separated PCR products</li>
    <li>Bioinformatics analysis and sequence alignment of genomic data generated by Sanger
        sequencing of the PCR<br> products using NCBI and CryptoDB databases, Biopython, Clustal Omega software.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Undergraduate internship and dissertation</strong></p>
   <p>I partook in a 6-months internship programme at the veterinary department of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Abuja where I joined a research team to investigate the prevalence of Fasciola hepatica in some selected farms. I leverage the skills gained during this internship to research soil-transmitted helminth infection in primary school pupils at Anyigba, Kogi State during my undergraduate project.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>The research internship and project require extensive use of statistical software (SPSS)</li>
    <li>A scientific write-up of my internship/project research findings was required at the end of
        my undergraduate studies to be awarded a Bachelor of Science degree
    </li>
